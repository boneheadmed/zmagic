A plugin for the Impact javascript game engine (http://impactjs.com/). This plugin extends ig.Game and ig.Entity with functions to directly manipulate the z index.

How to use:
Create a new plugins folder if one does not exist: lib/plugins
Create a new folder called zmagic: lib/plugins/zmagic
Place the zmagic.js file within that folder.
Within the main.js file, require: 'plugins.zmagic.zmagic'

Usage:

1) Initialize zmagic:

Within your main game's init function:

  init: function(){
        ....
        new ig.Zmagic();
        ....
  }

2) ig.Game.swapIndex function

   Used when you have a situation where you want to put one entity in front of another, but don't won't to modify the z index directly and sort, etc.  
   
       ig.game.swapzIndex(entityA, entityB);

3) ig.Entity.moveToFront

   Used to place an entity at the "front" or top of the list of entities. For example if you had a pointer entity that should always be above any newly generated entities. Within that enity:

      update: function() {
          ...
          this.moveToFront();
          this.parent();
      }
